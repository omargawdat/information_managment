Rewrite the chapter file at: $ARGUMENTS

This is for a **written exam focused on understanding** (not memorization).

You have **full creative freedom** to restructure the chapter for the best exam-prep result. You can:
- **Restructure** sections entirely — reorder, merge, split, or rename sections if it creates a better logical flow
- **Group** related concepts that are scattered across the chapter into unified sections
- **Remove** anything that is pure filler: specific statistics, historical trivia, lengthy illustrative examples that aren't directly testable
- **Add** brief clarifying sentences, transition lines, or summary tables if they help connect concepts
- **Combine** overlapping or redundant explanations into a single concise version
- **Concise** everything — say in one sentence what the original says in a paragraph

The goal is the clearest, most scannable structure for exam review. Don't preserve the original structure out of loyalty — rebuild it if a better structure exists.

## Content Rules

1. **Cut** filler: statistics, historical trivia, verbose examples that aren't testable
2. **Keep** formal definitions, named frameworks, named models, and citations (author, year)
3. **Keep** the "why" and relationships between concepts — these are what a written exam tests
4. **Keep** all formulas and their practical meaning
5. **Compress** verbose bullet lists into compact **tables** (property | meaning)
6. **Compress** multi-paragraph examples into 1-2 sentences making the same point
7. **Reorder** freely: put foundational frameworks first, then details that build on them
8. **Merge** sections that cover the same concept from different angles into one cohesive section

## Formatting Conventions

| Pattern | Use For |
|---------|---------|
| `> **Definition:**` blockquotes | Formal definitions and key takeaways |
| `> **Important:**` blockquotes | Warnings, common exam pitfalls |
| **Bold** | Key terms on first occurrence |
| Tables | Structured comparisons, multi-dimensional concepts, property lists |
| `---` horizontal rules | Visual separators between major parts |
| Numbered lists | Ordered sequences, hierarchies |
| Bullet lists | Only when items are truly unstructured |

## Process

1. Read the chapter file completely first
2. Identify what is testable understanding vs filler
3. Rewrite in place, keeping the same frontmatter unchanged
4. Aim for ~40% reduction in line count while preserving every testable concept
5. After rewriting, run `npm run build` to verify no errors
