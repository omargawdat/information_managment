Chapter 5.1: IT Strategy
======================
Topics: Corporate Strategy, Competitive Advantage, Aligning Strategies

Context in the Krcmar Model
---------------------------
IT Strategy belongs to the "Managing Information Management" layer — the overarching governance block that includes IT Strategy, IT Governance, IT Processes, IT HR, IT Controlling, and IT Security.

The Business-IT Relationship
----------------------------
Simple loop:
- Business "defines goals for" IT
- IT "transforms" Business

Extended loop (with context):
- Business Context "impacts through evolution of competition" on Business
- Business Context "evolves" on its own
- Business "defines goals for" IT
- IT "supports" Business
- IT "transforms" Business
- Business "transforms" Business Context

Status Quo (McKinsey 2016, n=709):
- Most companies treat IT as a "Supplier" (just a technology service provider)
- Most executives believe IT SHOULD be a "Partner" (actively collaborating to shape strategy)
- Gap between current role and desired role is significant

Three Main Questions of IT Management
--------------------------------------
IT Management is always caught between two tensions:
1. Strategic advantages through IT investments
2. Short-term IT cost control and reduction

IT increases company value often only indirectly. Three core questions:
1. Which IT services should be provided?
2. Who provides these IT services?
3. Are the IT services provided correctly (efficiently and effectively)?

Definitions
-----------
Strategy: A plan of action to achieve a particular goal.
- Short-term strategy: typically next 6 months
- Long-term strategy: typically 3-5 years

Strategic Management (Smith/Arnold/Bizzell, 1986): The process of:
- Examining both present and future environments
- Formulating the organization's objectives
- Making, implementing, and controlling decisions focused on achieving these objectives

Three Strategy Types (Earl, 1989):

IS Strategy (What?):
  Focuses on the system or business applications of IT. Primarily concerned with
  aligning them with business needs and using them to derive strategic benefits.

IT Strategy (How?):
  Concerned with the various aspects of the technology such as architecture,
  technical standards, security levels, risk attitudes, and technology policies.

IM Strategy (Who? Which way? Where?):
  Concerned with the structures and roles for the management of IS and IT.
  Focuses on the relationship between specialists and users, management control,
  performance measurement processes, management responsibilities.

Basic Strategy 101 — Five Simplified Steps
-------------------------------------------
1. Identify business strategy and goals.
2. Break goals down into concrete activities and processes.
3. Identify metrics to measure progress towards these goals.
4. Identify how IT can help progress for these activities.
5. Measure actual performance.

Steps 2-5 are supported by known tools: Balanced Scorecards, KPIs, OKRs, GQM, etc.
The hard part is Step 1: identifying the right business strategy.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: Generic Company Strategies
==============================================================

Three strategic viewpoints:
1. Market-based View (MBV) — focus on external competition
2. Resource-based View (RBV) — focus on internal strengths
3. Synthesis of MBV+RBV — SWOT Analysis

--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Market-based View (MBV): Porter's Models
--------------------------------------------------------------

Porter's Five Competitive Forces:
- The Firm vs. Competitors (center — industry rivalry)
- New market entrants (threat of new competition)
- Substitute products (threat of alternatives)
- Suppliers (bargaining power)
- Customers (bargaining power)

These five forces determine the competitive intensity and attractiveness of a market.

Porter's Generic Strategies (how IS supports each):

+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Strategy                  | How IS Supports It                                            |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Low-cost leadership       | Use IS to produce products/services at lower price than       |
|                           | competitors while enhancing quality and service level.         |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Product differentiation   | Use IS to differentiate products, enable new services         |
|                           | and products.                                                 |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Focus on market niche     | Use IS to enable a focused strategy on a single market        |
|                           | niche; specialize.                                            |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+
| Customer and supplier     | Use IS to develop strong ties and loyalty with customers      |
| intimacy                  | and suppliers.                                                |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+

Porter's Strategy Matrix (2x2):

                     Singularity (from           Cost
                     customer's perspective)     Advantage
                   +-------------------------+------------------+
  Industry wide    |  Product                |  Low-Cost        |
                   |  Differentiation        |  Leadership      |
                   +-------------------------+------------------+
  Industry segment |        Focus on market niche               |
                   +--------------------------------------------+

--------------------------------------------------------------
2. Resource-based View (RBV)
--------------------------------------------------------------

Core principle: Our success depends on ourselves, not just the competition.

"Depends on ourselves" breaks down into three levels:
- Vision (C-level): strategic direction
- Capabilities (middle management): ability to adapt resources and competencies
  to changing environments, using resources efficiently and effectively
- Resources (product & project management): Fixed assets, human capital, money,
  reputation/brands, management team, technology and patents, organizational
  culture, organizational structure

How to gain advantage through RBV:
- Keep tangible resources (e.g. factories) up to date
- Develop intangible resources (e.g. employee skills, culture, creativity),
  capabilities, and vision

VRIN Criteria — Resources and capabilities must be ALL FOUR for strategic advantage:
- Valuable: The resource provides value to the firm
- Rare: Not widely available to competitors
- Inimitable: Difficult or impossible to copy
- Non-Substitutional: No equivalent substitute exists

--------------------------------------------------------------
3. Synthesis of MBV + RBV: SWOT Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------

SWOT combines external analysis (MBV) with internal analysis (RBV):

                    Helpful                    Harmful
                    (to achieving objective)   (to achieving objective)
                  +-------------------------+-------------------------+
  Internal origin |                         |                         |
  (attributes of  |      Strengths          |      Weaknesses         |
  the organization|                         |                         |
                  +-------------------------+-------------------------+
  External origin |                         |                         |
  (attributes of  |      Opportunities      |      Threats            |
  the environment)|                         |                         |
                  +-------------------------+-------------------------+

- Strengths & Weaknesses = internal (RBV perspective)
- Opportunities & Threats = external (MBV perspective)

STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT
==============================================================

Key Definitions:

Strategic fit (Porter, 1996): Strategic fit among many activities is fundamental
not only to competitive advantage but also to the sustainability of that advantage.
It is harder for a rival to match an array of interlocked activities than to imitate
a single approach.

Strategic alignment (Reich & Benbasat, 2000): The extent to which the business
mission, objectives, and plans are supported by the IS mission, objectives, and plans.

Alignment (Henderson & Venkatraman, 1993): The degree of fit and integration among
business strategy, IT strategy, business infrastructure, and IT infrastructure.

The Strategic Alignment Model (SAM)
------------------------------------
Henderson & Venkatraman (1993). A 2x2 framework with four quadrants:

                        BUSINESS                    INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
                  +------------------------+   +------------------------+
     EXTERNAL     |   BUSINESS STRATEGY    |   |    I/T STRATEGY        |
                  | - Business Scope       |   | - Technology Scope     |
                  | - Distinctive          |   | - Systemic             |
                  |   Competencies         |   |   Competencies         |
                  | - Business Governance  |   | - I/T Governance       |
                  +------------------------+   +------------------------+
                         STRATEGIC FIT       AUTOMATION / LINKAGE
                  +------------------------+   +------------------------+
     INTERNAL     | ORGANIZATIONAL         |   | I/S INFRASTRUCTURE     |
                  | INFRASTRUCTURE         |   | AND PROCESSES          |
                  | - Administrative       |   | - Architectures        |
                  |   Infrastructure       |   | - Processes            |
                  | - Processes            |   | - Skills               |
                  | - Skills               |   |                        |
                  +------------------------+   +------------------------+
